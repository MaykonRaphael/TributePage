                    <strong>A little about Kobe Bryant</strong>
                    <p>Kobe Bryant spent his early years in Italy and joined the NBA
                        straight out of high school. A dominant scorer, Bryant won five
                        NBA championships and the 2008 MVP Award with the Los Angeles Lakers.
                        Although later seasons were marred by injuries, he surpassed
                        Michael Jordan for third place on the NBA all-time scoring list in
                        December 2014 and retired in 2016 after scoring 60 points in his final game.
                        In 2018, Bryant earned an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film
                        for Dear Basketball. On January 26, 2020, he was in a helicopter crash
                        that killed Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gigi and seven others.

                    <strong>Career</strong>
                    <p>He was selected by the Charlotte Hornets with the 13th overall pick
                        of the 1996 NBA draft, and was subsequently traded to the Los Angeles Lakers.
                    </p>
                    <p>In his second season as guard, with the Lakers, Bryant was voted a
                        starter for the 1998 All-Star Game, becoming at 19 the youngest
                        All-Star in NBA history. He then teamed up with superstar center
                        Shaquille O'Neal to win three consecutive NBA championships, and
                        was voted first-team all-NBA from 2002-04.
                    </p>
                    <p>In 2008, Bryant was named Most Valuable Player and carried his team
                        to the NBA Finals, where they lost to the Boston Celtics. In the 2009
                        NBA Finals, the Lakers beat the Orlando Magic to win the championship.
                        Shortly afterward, Bryant was part of the memorial service to honor
                        friend and music superstar Michael Jackson. The following year, the
                        Lakers won their second straight title by defeating the Celtics.
